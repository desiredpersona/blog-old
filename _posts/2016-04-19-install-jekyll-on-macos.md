[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a tool for transforming your plain text into static websites and blogs. It is simple, static, and blog-aware. Jekyll uses the [Liquid templating language](https://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-basics) and has built-in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and [Textile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_(markup_language)) support. It also ties in nicely to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) but I personal use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) to host this website for free. I highly recommend you join [Jekyll Talk](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/) the official support forum where you can ask questions and discuss all aspects of Jekyll. 

##  Install Xcode command line tools

Installing Jekyll is easy and straight-forward, but there are a few requirements you’ll need to make sure your system has before you start.


Install the Xcode Command Line Tools using your Terminal app.

```sh
xcode-select --install
```


## Install Homebrew

Next we will install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) a package manager for macOS.

**Why?**

We will use Homebrew to install Ruby. 

**Why macOS already comes with a version of Ruby?**

A lot of the system directories in macOS are locked down making it difficult to use.

Install Homebrew by entering the following command in your Terminal app and hitting the RETURN key.

```sh
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

You will now be prompted to hit the RETURN key again to continue.

Output:

```
MacBook-Pro:jekyll-test-site Colin$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
==> This script will install:
/usr/local/bin/brew
/usr/local/share/doc/homebrew
/usr/local/share/man/man1/brew.1
/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_brew
/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/brew
/usr/local/Homebrew
==> The following new directories will be created:
/usr/local/include
/usr/local/sbin
/usr/local/var
/usr/local/opt
/usr/local/share/zsh
/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions
/usr/local/var/homebrew
/usr/local/var/homebrew/linked
/usr/local/Cellar
/usr/local/Caskroom
/usr/local/Homebrew
/usr/local/Frameworks

Press RETURN to continue or any other key to abort
```

You will be prompted to enter your Admin Password to allow the install to continue.

Output:

```
==> /usr/bin/sudo /bin/mkdir -p /usr/local/include /usr/local/sbin /usr/local/var /usr/local/opt /usr/local/share/zsh /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions /usr/local/var/homebrew /usr/local/var/homebrew/linked /usr/local/Cellar /usr/local/Caskroom /usr/local/Homebrew /usr/local/Frameworks
Password:
```

The Homebrew install will continue after hitting the RETURN key.

Output:

```
==> /usr/bin/sudo /bin/chmod g+rwx /usr/local/include /usr/local/sbin /usr/local/var /usr/local/opt /usr/local/share/zsh /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions /usr/local/var/homebrew /usr/local/var/homebrew/linked /usr/local/Cellar /usr/local/Caskroom /usr/local/Homebrew /usr/local/Frameworks

```
ruby 2.3.7p456 (2018-03-28 revision 63024) [universal.x86_64-darwin18]
```

Update your Ruby path with the command.

```sh
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

Update your gems path with the command.

```sh
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

Relaunch your terminal for changes to take effect.

You can double check your Ruby path with the command `which ruby` and then your gem path by using `gem env`.

You may continue with installing Bundler and Jekyll below. The next section is only relevant to those who want to run multiple version of Ruby on their machines. It's completely overkill for most people.

## How to manage multiple version of Ruby using rbenv (Optional Step)

Install rbenv with the following command using Homebrew.

```sh
brew install rbenv
```

Output:

```
MacBook-Pro:jekyll-test-site Colin$ brew install rbenv

Set up rbenv in your shell.

```sh
rbenv init
```

Output:
```
MacBook-Pro:jekyll-test-site Colin$ rbenv init
# Load rbenv automatically by appending
# the following to ~/.bash_profile:

eval "$(rbenv init -)"

```

You can add the above line manually or run the following command to update your `.bash_profile` file.

```sh
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

Close your Terminal window and open a new one so your changes take effect.

Verify that rbenv is properly set up using this rbenv-doctor script:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/master/bin/rbenv-doctor | bash
```

Output:
```
MacBook-Pro:jekyll-test-site Colin$ curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/master/bin/rbenv-doctor | bash
Checking for `rbenv' in PATH: /usr/local/bin/rbenv
Checking for rbenv shims in PATH: OK
Checking `rbenv install' support: /usr/local/bin/rbenv-install (ruby-build 20181207)

  There aren't any Ruby versions installed under `/Users/Colin/.rbenv/versions'.
  You can install Ruby versions like so: rbenv install 2.2.4
Checking RubyGems settings: OK
Auditing installed plugins: OK
```

You can now list all available version of Ruby using `rbenv install -l`.

Let's install the latest stable release which is currently `Ruby 2.5.3` as of writing.

```sh
rbenv install 2.5.3
```

Output:

```
MacBook-Pro:jekyll-test-site Colin$ rbenv install 2.5.3
ruby-build: use openssl from homebrew
Downloading ruby-2.5.3.tar.bz2...
-> https://cache.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/2.5/ruby-2.5.3.tar.bz2
Installing ruby-2.5.3...
ruby-build: use readline from homebrew
Installed ruby-2.5.3 to /Users/Colin/.rbenv/versions/2.5.3
```

List all Ruby versions known to rbenv

```sh
rbenv versions
```

Output:
```
MacBook-Pro:jekyll-test-site Colin$ rbenv versions
  system
* 2.5.3 (set by /Users/Colin/.rbenv/version)
```

Set the global version of Ruby.

```sh
rbenv global 2.5.3
```

Confirm your global version of Ruby is set.

```sh
rbenv global
```

Output:
```
MacBook-Pro:jekyll-test-site Colin$ rbenv global
2.5.3
```

## Install Bundler

Installing [Bundler](https://bundler.io) provides a consistent environment for Ruby projects by tracking and installing the exact gems and versions that are needed.

```sh
gem install bundler
```

Output:
```
MacBook-Pro:jekyll-test-site Colin$ gem install bundler
Fetching: bundler-1.17.1.gem (100%)
Successfully installed bundler-1.17.1
Parsing documentation for bundler-1.17.1
Installing ri documentation for bundler-1.17.1
Done installing documentation for bundler after 3 seconds
1 gem installed
```

## Installing Jekyll

Finally it's time to install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) static site generator.

```sh
gem install jekyll
```

Check the Jekyll version.

```sh
jekyll -v
```

Done!

## Updating Jekyll

Bundler updates your gems to the latest versions by simply running the following command while in your sites directory.

```sh
bundle update
```
